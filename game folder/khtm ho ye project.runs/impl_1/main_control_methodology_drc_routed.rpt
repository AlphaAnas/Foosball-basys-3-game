2. REPORT DETAILS
-----------------
TIMING-6#1 Critical Warning
No common primary clock between related clocks  
The clocks clk_out1_clk_wiz_0 and clk_out1_clk_wiz_0_1 are related (timed together) but they have no common primary clock. The design could fail in hardware. To find a timing path between these clocks, run the following command: report_timing -from [get_clocks clk_out1_clk_wiz_0] -to [get_clocks clk_out1_clk_wiz_0_1]
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-6#2 Critical Warning
No common primary clock between related clocks  
The clocks clk_out1_clk_wiz_0_1 and clk_out1_clk_wiz_0 are related (timed together) but they have no common primary clock. The design could fail in hardware. To find a timing path between these clocks, run the following command: report_timing -from [get_clocks clk_out1_clk_wiz_0_1] -to [get_clocks clk_out1_clk_wiz_0]
Related violations: <none>

LUTAR-1#1 Warning
LUT drives async reset alert  
LUT cell player1_score[3]_i_3, with 2 or more inputs, drives asynchronous preset/clear pin(s) player1_score_reg[0]/CLR, player1_score_reg[1]/CLR,
player1_score_reg[2]/CLR, player1_score_reg[3]/CLR. The LUT may glitch and trigger an unexpected reset, even if it is a properly timed path.
Related violations: <none>

LUTAR-1#2 Warning
LUT drives async reset alert  
LUT cell player2_score[3]_i_3, with 2 or more inputs, drives asynchronous preset/clear pin(s) player2_score_reg[0]/CLR, player2_score_reg[1]/CLR,
player2_score_reg[2]/CLR, player2_score_reg[3]/CLR. The LUT may glitch and trigger an unexpected reset, even if it is a properly timed path.
Related violations: <none>

SYNTH-10#1 Warning
Wide multiplier  
Detected multiplier at nolabel_line115/display_ball1 of size 16x18, it is decomposed from a wide multipler into 4 DSP blocks.
Related violations: <none>

SYNTH-10#2 Warning
Wide multiplier  
Detected multiplier at nolabel_line115/display_ball1__0 of size 18x18, it is decomposed from a wide multipler into 4 DSP blocks.
Related violations: <none>

SYNTH-10#3 Warning
Wide multiplier  
Detected multiplier at nolabel_line115/display_ball1__1 of size 18x16, it is decomposed from a wide multipler into 4 DSP blocks.
Related violations: <none>

SYNTH-10#4 Warning
Wide multiplier  
Detected multiplier at nolabel_line115/display_ball1__2 of size 16x18, it is decomposed from a wide multipler into 4 DSP blocks.
Related violations: <none>

SYNTH-10#5 Warning
Wide multiplier  
Detected multiplier at nolabel_line115/display_ball1__3 of size 18x18, it is decomposed from a wide multipler into 4 DSP blocks.
Related violations: <none>

SYNTH-10#6 Warning
Wide multiplier  
Detected multiplier at nolabel_line115/display_ball1__4 of size 18x16, it is decomposed from a wide multipler into 4 DSP blocks.
Related violations: <none>
